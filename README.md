# Intro to VR Class - Fall 2022

<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>If you're reading this it means you've stumbled on some classwork I am doing for my graduate studies, your my classmate, my professor, or some internet person who has found this.</p>

<p>By all accounts, please be kind when looking at this code as I am learning virtual and augmented reality best practices. If you have accessibility tips or any input that is helpful, please feel free to reach out to me.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>
